When conducting vulnerability research according to this policy, we:

1. will not take civil action or file a complaint with law enforcement authorities against you for accidental, good faith violations of the policy

2. interpret activities that comply with the policy as authorized access under the Swiss Penal Code. This includes Swiss Penal Code paragraphs 143, 143<sup>bis</sup> and 144<sup>bis</sup>.

3. will not file a complaint against you for trying to circumvent the security measures deployed in order to protect the services in-scope according this policy.

If legal action is initiated by a third party against you and you have complied with the policy as outlined in this document, we will take the necessary measures to make it known to the authorities that your actions have been conducted in compliance with this policy.

You are expected, as always, to comply with all applicable laws.

If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your security research is consistent with this policy, please submit a report through one of our Official Channels before going any further.
